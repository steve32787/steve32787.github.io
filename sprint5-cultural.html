<h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
<p>I always doubted myself and thought that I was not smart enough to code.  Neuroplasticity and growth mindset core learning during sprint 4 has helped me to think again about myself. 
     I’ve never tried, nor studied as hard enough to tell myself that I am a bad coder.  I would need to practice and invest time so that my brain can grow to become a better coder. </p><br>

<p>I’ve never tried an IQ test but I’ve been thinking that my IQ won’t be as high as others.  
    My EQ is not high either as I am not a social person.  During Sprint 3 I’ve learnt that EQ is highly important during workplace.  I would need to try hard to build this to grow my EQ. </p><br>

<h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence tend to cover empathy, values and self-awareness.  
My mental health, relationships and social intelligence are fundamental to emotional intelligence.  Social  awareness,  self-awareness and self-management would enhance my learning curve.  </p><br>

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<p>Core learning definitely helped me to overcome some obstacles while coding.  I’ve been listening to some TED clips and they helped me to overcome depressing moments. </p><br>
<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>
<p>Technical learning > Core learning.  This was always on my head.  
    My time was quite limited due to full time working during foundations so I’ve skimmed read most of the articles and did little research as I
     thought investing time on technical learning was more important.  </p> <br>
<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h3>
<p>Core learning is actually more important than technical learning.  I’ve seen articles about how technical skills is less important than core skills.  
    Recruiters prioritizes on core skills as technical skills can be improved while core skills has less ability to be enhanced.  </p><br>
<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>Definitely not a waste of time.  I just hoped that I had more time so that I could have spent more time doing both core and technical learning through the foundations.  
    As I was short of time for most sprints, I tend to focus more on challenges than core learning. </p><br><br>
