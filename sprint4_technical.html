            <h3> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3><br>

<h3> Got blocked on a simple problem: </h3>
<p>The answer was very simple but was struggling with it.  After looking into it from different angles, realised it was very simple.  </p> <br>

<h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3><br>
<p>In both cases: Used Pseudocode and googling.</p><br>


<h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
<p>I'vve mostly used Googling.  </p><br>

<h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
<p>I felt very depressed and anxious.  I wanted to give up. </p><br>

<h3>What did you learn?</h3> 
<p>'ve learnt that I had long way to go with coding.</p><br>

<h3>
Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:<h3></h3>
<p>
Pseudocode: Not that confident, you need some knowledge in order to do Pseudocoding effectively.  <br>
Trying something: Yup, definitely tried even though I no idea.<br>
Rubber ducky method: Did not try this as I do not have a rubber duck. <br>
Reading error messages: Yes, this helped but not too confident yet. <br>
Console.logging: I've tried this on Scrimba but was not too successfull using this.  Not too sure why.  <br>
Googling: I am confident on Googling and it is effective. <br>
Asking your peers for help: As I am very earlier, I have not engaged with others in the cohort. <br>
Asking coaches for help: Yes sometimes but it was hard when I work fulltime.  <br>
Improving your process with reflection: Yes, confident about this now.   </p>
