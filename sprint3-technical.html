            <h3>JavaScript, The DOM and DevTools</h3><br><br><br>


 <h3> Q) An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3><br>
<p>HTML is like a skeleton of the website and CSS is to make it look nicer.</p> <br>

<h3> Q)	Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3><br>
<p>Control flow is how the order of our daily life runs.  For instance, waking up, having meals at a certain time and going to the toilet.  Depending on a certain variable – such as how many drinks you have during the day, or meals, frequency of going to the bathroom may change but they usually have a certain order.  
Loops is executed as long as condition is true.  As long as you want to keep yourself clean, you would need to have a daily shower.  Same goes to washing your hair.  </p> <br>


<h3> Q) Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3><br>
<p></p>the Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
For example, the standard DOM specifies that the getElementsByTagName method in the code below must return a list of all the <P> <br>
<p>elements in the document: </P>
<li>	var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");</li>
<li>// paragraphs[0] is the first p element</li>
<li>// paragraphs[1] is the second p element, etc.</li>
<li>	alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName); </li> <br>





<h3> Q) Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h3><br>
<p>You want to use arrays when order is the most important factor for organizing the information.  For instance, books would have page orders which are important to follow.  Page 1 of a book would be index 0 as Arrays are 0-indexed.  
For Objects, data label is most important, where it is best when we want to oranise based on data labels.  For example, when reading a newspaper, most of the time you flip onto a section that you are interested in, where the most relevant context is.  Objects organise this info via key/value pairs = key: value.
If you want to access an economy section within a newspaper, you would use the key like this = newspaper [‘economy’] or newspaper.business. </p> <br>


<h3> Q) Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3><br>
<p>A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when something invokes it (calls it).  
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
Function in JavaScript is useful as they alone play roles that other languages fulfill with multiple distinct features: procedures, methods, constructors and even classes and modules. Every one of this is covered by the versatility of functions. </p><br><br><br>
