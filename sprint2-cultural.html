                                            <h2> What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2><br>
                                                  <p>
                                                  Firstly, I would like to have solid understanding of main concepts of coding so that it could help me to interpret and solve complex coding challenges.  
                                                  I love designing and would like to get hands on experience as a front end developer but at the same time I wish I could have solid understanding of back end development also.  
                                                  Becoming a developer is my goal and I’ve been working towards this for a while now but my coding skills is much below par.  So will work hard during the Dev Academy course and hopefully I can land a dream job afterwards. </p> <br>
                                                  
                                          <h2> A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2><br>
                                          <h4>My main strength:</h4>
                                          <p>I believe I am very reliable and have a strong mind set to accomplish my goals. <br>
                                          I also have 6 years of work experience (not as a developer).  </p> <br>
                                          <h4> I am working to improve:</h4>
                                          <p>My time management skills.  <br>
                                          Improve my self-confidence.<br>
                                          Improve my public speaking skills.</p> <br>

                                          <h3> Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
                                              This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3><br>
                                          <p>I learn something new pretty much every single day through the foundations and this definitely keeps me motivated.  As I work full time, managing my workload is quite difficult.  
                                              I would need to use slack more to engage with other learners and facilitators but this isn’t easy as I work normal working hours.  
                                                  I would need to use Toggl more effectively to improve my time management skills and plan my week once the new Sprint starts.  
                                                  </p> <br>

                                                 <h3>	What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h3>
                                                 <p>My goal to be become a programmer.  It would be great to become a developer for the company that I work for (Vodafone) but I do not actually mind as long as I can become employed as a developer.  I would love to gain some experiences in New Zealand and move to other counties like Australia.  
                                                  Becoming employed as a developer straight after the graduation from the bootcamp would be the best scenario but I 
                                                  understand this can be hard and I would need to continue to study and work on portfolios even after the graduation.   </p> <br>
                                                  <h3>>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
                                                  <p>I’ve wrote down that I have a ‘strong mindset to accomplish my goals’.  I totally disagree with this now.  I have a very weak mindset and struggled to cope with the materials during the foundations and I am now worried that I will struggle even more during the Bootcamp.  
                                                  I believe I have very weak mentality where I tend to become anxious and over stressed.  I would need to learn to control my emotions during the Bootcamp. </p> <br>
                                                  
                                                  <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
                                                  <p>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
                                                  I have very poor public speaking skills.  I tend to freeze and feel very uncomfortable speaking in front of a group.  
                                                  I am also worried that I would struggle to control my emotions as I personally have difficulties controlling stress and anxiousness. </p><br>
                                                  
                                                  <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                                                  <p>I would like to feel comfortable when speaking in front of a group.  
                                                  I would like to teamwork and technical communication skills is something that I would like to develop too. </p><br>
                                                  
                                                  <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
                                                  <p></p>I would love to get help and walk me through if I struggle to understand something.  Most frustrating thing about the foundations course was the facilitator was only available during working hours.  I was unable to reach out during these hours as I was working.  
                                                  Due to full time work during the foundations course, I was unable to take in much over the 5 sprints.  I had skipped some parts that I was struggling for too long.</p><br>
                                                  <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
                                                  <p>I tried my best during the foundations course so that I could become a sponge and absorb everything that is taught through the bootcamp.  I honestly do not feel that I am ready at this point.
                                                  I hope I can manage the workload during the bootcamp and do not become too anxious about the workload.  I will revise on every materials learnt through the bookcamp. </p>
