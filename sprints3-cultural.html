<p>IQ, or intelligence quotient, is a number derived from a standardized intelligence test. On the original IQ tests, scores were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by his or her chronological age and then multiplying that number by 100.
EQ, on the other hand, is a measure of a person's level of emotional intelligence. This refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions. </p><br>
<h3> Q) Why is it important? </h3><br>

Emotional Intelligence, and our ability to draw on it as a reserve helps us in so many ways: from assisting in looking after our physical and mental health 
and well-being, through to our ability to inspire and lead. Itâ€™s there in our ability to manage effective relationships and our armour and shield when it comes to conflict resolution. It is, in so many ways, the driver of success.</p><br><br><br>
