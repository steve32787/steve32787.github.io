                                            <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h1><br>
                                            <p>When I was working as a grocery assistant at Pak n Save, I’ve saw a customer drop a hundred dollar note.  I was only 18 back then and $100 worth a lot of money to me (also at present) and it would take nearly 10 hours work to earn $100. 
                                                There was a brief moment where thought about the advantages of keeping the $100 to myself but it was not ethical to do so and conflicted with my responsibilities as a grocery assistance.   
                                                Nevertheless, I quickly picked it up and given it back to the customer.  The customer thanked me and later sent an email to the store to thank me for the kindness and honestly.</p> <br>

                                                <p>Most Koreans have strict perspective when it comes to educational background of individuals.  
                                                        Educational background and career is often a strong element in portraying individual’s personality and how liable they are in Korean culture.  
                                                        Hence, I value responsibility as a fundamental aspect of individuals and hence this is a core component in identifying myself. 
                                                        This has lead me to work hard to achieve various qualifications and always try my hard to become the best at what I do.  <p><br>

                                                                I've been working at the same company for around 7 years and I've been a very reliable and a hard worker.  I've been loyal to the company believing that there would be future career development within the company. 
                                                                I've achieved various qualifications while working full-time, believing that one day, there would be an right opportunity for me within the company.  In terms of learning and career development, it is definitely great

                                                                <p>I believe my main strengths are being responsible and highly committed to accomplish my goals.  I tend to keep my promises and honor commitments that I’ve made.  I organise my time effectively to take care of myself and 
                                                                  complete duties in a timely manner.  
                                                                        Being responsible mentally sets myself to keep to my time schedule and avoid temptation of obstacles such as socializing or playing my favourite video game.  
                                                                        Fatigue and lack of time are the major obstacles when working full-time and studying.  Therefore, effective time management skills and responsibility is fundamental to success.   
                                                                        Responsibility is something that I highly value and I highly consider this as my strength.  
                                                                        Giving up on something is against my rules and being responsible helps me to achieve something that I truly want to obtain.  
                                                                        </p> <br>

Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h1> <br>
                                                                        <p1>During my group project that I had to complete last year, we divided the tasks into parts and shared it among the group members.  We had a month to complete the project and set a weekly meeting.  
                                                                          The meetings were ineffective as some members did not complete some promised tasks and had no clear picture of the final product of the project.  It felt as if we required more regular meetings and break down of tasks into smaller parts to bring more flexibility within our project.  Some were just reluctant to contribute towards the project and this definitely hurt the productivity of the project.
                                                                        The strategy that I would use would be based on an agile environment where we would have regular meetings (sprint) and low fidelity and/or high fidelity prototype would be created earlier in the project.  </p1>
