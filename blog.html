<h1>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h1>
<h1></h1>When I was working as a grocery assistant at Pak n Save, I’ve saw a customer drop a hundred dollar note.  I was only 18 back then and $100 worth a lot of money to me (also at present) and it would take nearly 10 hours work to earn $100.  Nevertheless, I quickly picked it up and given it back to the customer.  The customer thanked me and later sent an email to Albany PaknSave to thank again for the kindness.</p> 
 

<h1>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h1>
<p>Most Koreans have strict perspective when it comes to educational background of individuals.  
Educational background and career is often a strong element in portraying individual’s personality and how liable they are in Korean culture.  Hence, I value responsibility as a fundamental aspect of individuals and hence this is a core component in identifying myself. This has lead me to work hard to achieve university qualifications and always try my hard to become the best at what I do.

<h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h1>
<p>Like mentioned earlier, I decided to pick up the $100 and give it back to the customer as my responsibility as a grocery assistant at Pak N Save was to help customers.  There was a brief moment where thought about the advantages of keeping the $100 to myself but this conflicted with my responsibility of assisting customers to have a great experience shopping at Pak n Save.  The idea of working hard as a sense of responsibility to earn money/wage is definitely a strength of an individual and also beneficial to the company.  
At the same time, I could have earned an easy money of $100 which was equal to nearly 10 hours of work at Pak n Save.  Some people could argue that being too ethical and responsible can be cause limitations? </p>

<h1>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h1>
<p>Due to my culture, educational background is definitely important which helped in terms of continuous achievement of various qualifications hence boosted my learning curve.  However, I was not too satisfied with my career development.  I’ve been continuously trying my best to qualify myself and gain new knowledge through it and expected it to help with my career development but I was not entirely successfully in achieving this.  This somewhat lead into myself being low self-esteem and caused stress and pressure. </p>   
<h1>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h1>
<p>I believe my main strengths are being responsible and effective time management skills.  I tend to keep my promises and honor commitments that I’ve made.  I organise my time effectively to take care of myself and complete duties in a timely manner,  
Being responsible mentally sets myself to keep to my time schedule and avoid temptation of obstacles such as socializing or playing my favourite video game.  
Fatigue and lack of time are the major obstacles when working full-time and studying.  Therefore, effective time management skills and responsibility is fundamental to success.   
Responsibility is something that I highly value and I highly consider this as my strength.  Giving up on something is against my rules and being responsible helps me to achieve something that I truly want to obtain.  During my full time work and studying part time, there were so many obstacles.  For instance, the temptation of socializing and enjoying my weekend with my friends and family and most importantly, lack of time and </p>
<h1>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h1>
<p1>During my group project that I had to complete last year, we divided the tasks into parts and shared it among the group members.  We had a month to complete the project and set a weekly meeting.  The meetings were ineffective as some members did not complete some promised tasks and had no clear picture of the final product of the project.  It felt as if we required more regular meetings and break down of tasks into smaller parts to bring more flexibility within our project.  Some were just reluctant to contribute towards the project and this definitely hurt the productivity of the project.
The strategy that I would use would be based on an agile environment where we would have regular meetings (sprint) and low fidelity and/or high fidelity prototype would be created earlier in the project.  </p1>
