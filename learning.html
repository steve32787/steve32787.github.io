                                                    What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2><br>
                                                    <p>
                                                    Firstly, I would like to have solid understanding of main concepts of coding so that it could help me to interpret and solve complex coding challenges.  
                                                    I love designing and would like to get hands on experience as a front end developer but at the same time I wish I could have solid understanding of back end development also.  
                                                    Becoming a developer is my goal and I’ve been working towards this for a while now but my coding skills is much below par.  So will work hard during the Dev Academy course and hopefully I can land a dream job afterwards. </p> <br>
                                                    
                                            <h2> A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2><br>
                                            <h4>My main strength:</h4>
                                            <p>I believe I am very reliable and have a strong mind set to accomplish my goals. <br>
                                            I also have 6 years of work experience (not as a developer).  </p> <br>
                                            <h4> I am working to improve:</h4>
                                            <p>My time management skills.  <br>
                                            Improve my self-confidence.<br>
                                            Improve my public speaking skills.</p> <br>

                                            <h3> Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
                                                This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3><br>
                                            <p>I learn something new pretty much every single day through the foundations and this definitely keeps me motivated.  As I work full time, managing my workload is quite difficult.  
                                                I would need to use slack more to engage with other learners and facilitators but this isn’t easy as I work normal working hours.  
                                                    I would need to use Toggl more effectively to improve my time management skills and plan my week once the new Sprint starts.  
                                                    </p>
