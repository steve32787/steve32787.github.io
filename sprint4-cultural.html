<h3>Research Neuroplasticity</h3>	<br><br><br>
<h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people <h3> <br>
    <p>It sets a belief that individuals can become smarter</p><br>

<h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
<p>I always thought to myself that I am not as smart as others.  I was always doubting myself that I was bad at math, I do not get much results compared to the input.  
    But this principle made me realise again that my brain will function and become smarter by continuously studying and building more ‘traffic’ towards the knowledge that I want to gain.  </p><br>
<h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity </h3>
<p>By continuously studying, practicing, thinking/imagining.  </p><br>
<h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
<p>https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/ </p><br>
<h3>2.	Research Growth Mindset </h3>
<h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant </h3>
<p>In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. 
    They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.” </p><br>

<h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
<p>I had my beliefs relatively on fixed mindset but you can definitely try to make it grow.  Some may take more advantage of growth mindset than others based on their fixed intelligent level?</p><br>
<h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? </h3>
<p>I would need to believe in myself that I can become smarter and drastically improve on my coding skills if I try my best. </p><br>
<h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

<h3>3.	Blend with your learning plan and strategies </h3>
<h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. </h3>
<p>I would need to add confidence.  I always had low self-esteem.  Confidence would help me grow.  
The shape of my brain will change and would build a stronger traffic towards my coding knowledge by continuously practicing, thinking/imagining, studying. 
I will never doubt myself by saying that I am not smart as others.  
I will most likely struggle during the boot camp but I will tell myself that I am ‘not yet’ confident on this but soon I definitely will be.  
Our intelligence and ability can grow.  </p>
