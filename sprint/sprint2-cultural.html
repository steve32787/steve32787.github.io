    <h2>
          What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2><br>
          <p>
          Firstly, I would like to have solid understanding of main concepts of coding so that it could help me to interpret and solve complex coding challenges.  
          I love designing and would like to get hands on experience as a front end developer but at the same time I wish I could have solid understanding of back end development also.  
          Becoming a developer is my goal and I’ve been working towards this for a while now but my coding skills is much below par.  So will work hard during the Dev Academy course and hopefully I can land a dream job afterwards. </p> <br>
          
  <h2> A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2><br>
  <h4>My main strength:</h4>
  <p>I believe I am very reliable and have a strong mind set to accomplish my goals. <br>
  I also have 6 years of work experience (not as a developer).  </p> <br>
  <h4> I am working to improve:</h4>
  <p>My time management skills.  <br>
  Improve my self-confidence.<br>
  Improve my public speaking skills.</p> <br>

  <h3> Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
      This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3><br>
  <p>I learn something new pretty much every single day through the foundations and this definitely keeps me motivated.  As I work full time, managing my workload is quite difficult.  
      I would need to use slack more to engage with other learners and facilitators but this isn’t easy as I work normal working hours.  
          I would need to use Toggl more effectively to improve my time management skills and plan my week once the new Sprint starts.
